### Set up

Check you have the correct version of Node. You can [install NVM to switch between node versions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating). Then `NVM install`.
Before you build you will need to `yarn install` in the root directory.
The repository includes a number of template .env files for different networks. Copy from these to the .env file before `serve` to launch app with different network. You can serve any application with `yarn nx run <name-of-app>:serve`.

### Build

Run `nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

Run `nx serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Running tests

Run `yarn nx run <my-app>-e2e:e2e` to execute the e2e tests with [cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/), or `nx affected:e2e` will execute just the end-to-end tests affected by a change. You can use the `--watch` flag to open the cypress tests UI in watch mode, see [cypress executor](https://nx.dev/packages/cypress/executors/cypress) for all CLI flags.

Run `nx test my-app` to execute the unit tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io), or `nx affected:test` to execute just unit tests affected by a change. You can also use `--watch` with these test to run jest in watch mode, see [Jest executor](https://nx.dev/packages/jest/executors/jest) for all CLI flags.

### Formatting

In CI linting, formatting and also run. These checks can be seen in the [CI workflow file](.github/workflows//test.yml).

- To fix linting errors locally run `yarn nx lint --fix`
- To fix formatting errors local run `yarn nx format`
- For either command you may use `--all` to run across the entire repository
