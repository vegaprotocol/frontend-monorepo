# Vega front-end monorepo

The front-end monorepo provides a toolkit for building apps that interact with Vega, as well as the apps themselves.

This repository is managed using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## üîé Applications in this repo

### [Block explorer](./apps/explorer)

The Vega block explorer provides an interface that allows users to search for and see transactions, blocks, parties, assets, markets and more on the Vega chain.

## üíª Develop

### Set up

Check you have the correct version of Node. You can [install NVM to switch between node versions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating). Then `NVM install`.
Before you build you will need to `yarn install` in the root directory.
The repository includes a number of template .env files for different networks. Copy from these to the .env file before `serve` to launch app with different network. You can serve any application with `yarn nx run <name-of-app>:serve`.

### Build

Run `nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

Run `nx serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to the port specified in `app/<project-name>/project.json`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Using Apollo GraphQL and Generate Types

In order to generate the schemas for your GraphQL queries, you can run `GRAPHQL_SCHEMA_PATH=[YOUR SCHEMA FILE / API URL HERE] nx run types:generate`.

```bash
export  GRAPHQL_SCHEMA_PATH=https://api.n07.testnet.vega.xyz/graphql
yarn nx run types:generate
```

### Running tests

Run `yarn nx run <my-app>-e2e:e2e` to execute the e2e tests with [cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/), or `nx affected:e2e` will execute just the end-to-end tests affected by a change. You can use the `--watch` flag to open the cypress tests UI in watch mode, see [cypress executor](https://nx.dev/packages/cypress/executors/cypress) for all CLI flags.

Run `nx test my-app` to execute the unit tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io), or `nx affected:test` to execute just unit tests affected by a change. You can also use `--watch` with these test to run jest in watch mode, see [Jest executor](https://nx.dev/packages/jest/executors/jest) for all CLI flags.

### Using wallet

To run tests locally using your own wallets make sure you have generated at least two public keys and update the following environment variables in `cypress.config.js` to match your wallet.

1. Set `VEGA_PUBLIC_KEY` and `TRUNCATED_VEGA_PUBLIC_KEY` to your first public key.
2. Set `VEGA_PUBLIC_KEY2` and `TRUNCATED_VEGA_PUBLIC_KEY2` to your second public key.
3. Set `TRADING_TEST_VEGA_WALLET_PASSPHRASE` as your wallet passphrase
4. Add `ETH_WALLET_MNEMONIC` as your Ethereum wallet mnemonic

### Formatting

In CI linting, formatting and also run. These checks can be seen in the [CI workflow file](.github/workflows//test.yml).

- To fix linting errors locally run `yarn nx lint --fix`
- To fix formatting errors local run `yarn nx format:write`
- For either command you may use `--all` to run across the entire repository

## üêã Hosting a console

To host a console there are two possible build scenarios for running the frontends: nx performed **outside** or **inside** docker build. For specific build instructions follow [build instructions](#build-instructions).

In order to run a container on port 3000:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:80 [TAG]
```

On top of that there are two possible scenarios for running docker image - using nginx server (default) of ipfs daemon.

to run ipfs on port 3000:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:80 [TAG] /run-ipfs.sh
```

to run nginx on port 3000:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:80 [TAG]
```

## Build instructions

The [`docker`](./docker) subfolder has some docker configurations for easily setting up your own hosted version of Console either for the web, or ready for pinning on IPFS.

### nx build inside the docker

Using multistage dockerfile dist is compiled using [node](https://hub.docker.com/_/node) image and later packed to nginx as in [dist build](#dist-build). The multistage builds ensures consistent CPU architecture and build toolchains are used so that the result will be identical.

```bash
docker build --build-arg APP=[YOUR APP] --build-arg NODE_VERSION=20.9.1 --build-arg ENV_NAME=mainnet -t [TAG] -f docker/node-inside-docker.Dockerfile .
```

### Computing ipfs-hash of the build

At the moment this feature is important only for Console releases.

Each docker build finishes with hash calculation for ` dist`` directory. Resulting hash is added to file named as  `/ipfs-hash`. Once docker image is produced you can run following commad to display ipfs-hash:

```bash
make recalculate-ipfs TAG=vegaprotocol/trading:{YOUR_VERSION}
```

**updating hash:** recompiling dist directory (even if there are no changed to source code) results in different hash computed by ipfs command.

### nx build outside the docker

This Docker image packages a pre-built `dist` folder into an [`nginx`](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx)([server configuration](./nginx/nginx.conf)) docker image. In this case, the application on docker host machine from source.

As a prerequisite you need to perform build of `dist` directory and move its content for specific application to `dist-result` directory. Use following script to do it with a single command:

```bash
./docker/prepare-dist.sh
```

You can build any of the containers locally with the following command:

```bash
docker build -f docker/node-outside-docker.Dockerfile . --tag=[TAG]
```

### Verifying ipfs-hash of existing current application version

An IPFS CID will be attached to every [release](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/frontend-monorepo/releases). If you are intending to pin an application on IPFS, you can check that your build matches by running the following steps:

1. Show latest release by running: `make latest-release`. You need to configure [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) for this step to work, otherwise please provide release manually from [github](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/frontend-monorepo/releases) or [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/vegaprotocol/trading)
2. Set RELEASE environment variable to value that you want to validate: `export RELEASE=$(make latest-release)` or `export RELEASE=vXX.XX.XX`
3. Set TAG environment variable to image that you want to validate: `export TAG=vegaprotocol/trading:$RELEASE`
4. Download docker image with the desired release `docker pull $TAG`.
5. Recalculate hash: `make recalculate-ipfs`
6. You should see exactly same hash produced by ipfs command as one placed with the release notes: `make show-latest-release`
7. If you want to extract dist from docker image to your local filesystem you can run following command: `make unpack`
8. Now `dist` directory contains valid application build

## Config

As environment variables are build time and not run time in frontend applications. We have built a system which allows for passing run time environment variables, this generates a JSON file that will override the default environment variables that the container was built with (which is always testnet, using the default .env files).

In order to override specific environment variables you can pass these to the container like this:

```bash
docker run -e NX_VEGA_URL=https://api.n04.d.vega.xyz/graphql -p 3000:80 [TAG]
```

Which will now point the app to use a devnet data node. To see a list of all possible config properties see the readme.md for each app in the app directory.

## Vega capsule

Coming soon! You will be able to run the containers within Vega Capsule.

You can run against a local instance of Vega Capsule today by using the .env.capsule present in the apps.

If you wish to run E2E tests for Token and Block Explorer (other areas to be added soon)

- Vegacapsule must be used in order for these tests to succeed, the vegacapsule repo README.md file contains the steps required to set this up, it must be installed globally.
- However we start the capsule network a little differently to how it is laid out in those instructions:

In order to run the bootstrap command to generate and start a new network, we must do so using the following:

```bash
vegacapsule network bootstrap --config-path=../frontend-monorepo/vegacapsule/config.hcl
```

In order to setup and run vegawallet for e2e capsule tests, in a separate terminal window:

1. cd into `./vegacapsule`
2. run:

```bash
bash setup-vegawallet.sh
```

3. copy generated `api-token` and paste the token into `CYPRESS_VEGA_WALLET_API_TOKEN` environment variable in either `apps/governance-e2e/.env` or `apps/explorer-e2e/.env` depending on which project needs testing.

Note: The script is only needed if capsule was built for first time or fresh. To run existing wallet service for capsule:

```bash
vega wallet service run -n DV --load-tokens --tokens-passphrase-file passphrase --no-version-check --automatic-consent --home ~/.vegacapsule/testnet/wallet
```
