# ðŸ’» Develop

### Build

Run `nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

Run `nx serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Running tests

Run `nx test my-app` to execute the unit tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io), or `nx affected:test` to execute just unit tests affected by a change.

Similarly `nx e2e my-app` will execute the end-to-end tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io)., and `nx affected:e2e` will execute just the end-to-end tests affected by a change.
