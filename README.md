# Vega front-end monorepo

The front-end monorepo provides a toolkit for building apps that interact with Vega, as well as the apps themselves.

This repository is managed using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

# ðŸ”Ž Applications in this repo

### [Block explorer](./apps/explorer)

The Vega block explorer provides an interface that allows users to search for and see transactions, blocks, parties, assets, markets and more on the Vega chain.

### [Trading UI](./apps/trading)

The trading interface built based on a component toolkit. It will provide a way for participants to interact with markets and provide resources for others to build additional open-source user interfaces.

### [Token](./apps/token)

The utility dApp for interacting with the Vega token and using its' utility. This includes; delegation, nomination, governance and redemption of tokens.

### [Explorer](./apps/explorer)

The block explorer for the Vega network, showing details of raw chain states and the state of markets on the Vega network.

### [Stats](./apps/stats)

An application for the status of the Vega network. Showing block height and other network activity.

### [Static](./apps/static)

Hosting for static content being shared across apps, for example fonts.

# ðŸ§± Libraries in this repo

### [UI toolkit](./libs/ui-toolkit)

The UI toolkit contains a set of components used to build interfaces that can interact with the Vega protocol, and follow the design style of the project.
It contains a storybook that can be served with `yarn nx run ui-toolkit:storybook`.

### [Tailwind CSS config](./libs/tailwindcss-config)

The Tailwind CSS config contains theme that align default config with Vega design system.

### [Cypress](./libs/cypress)

For shared Cypress logic, commands and steps.

### [Web3](./libs/web3)

A utility library for connecting to the Ethereum network and interacting with Vega Web3 contracts.

### [React Helpers](./libs/react-helpers)

Generic react helpers that can be used across multiple applications, along with other utilities.

# ðŸ’» Develop

### Set up

Check you have the correct version of Node. You can [install NVM to switch between node versions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating). Then `NVM install`.
Before you build you will need to `yarn install` in the root directory.
The repository includes a number of template .env files for different networks. Copy from these to the .env file before `serve` to launch app with different network. You can serve any application with `yarn nx run <name-of-app>:serve`.

### Build

Run `nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

Run `nx serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to the port specified in `app/<project-name>/project.json`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Using Apollo GraphQL and Generate Types

In order to generate the schemas for your GraphQL queries, you can run `NX_VEGA_URL=[YOUR URL HERE] nx run types:generate`.

```bash
export  NX_VEGA_URL=https://api.n11.testnet.vega.xyz/graphql
yarn nx run types:generate
```

### Running tests

Run `yarn nx run <my-app>-e2e:e2e` to execute the e2e tests with [cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/), or `nx affected:e2e` will execute just the end-to-end tests affected by a change. You can use the `--watch` flag to open the cypress tests UI in watch mode, see [cypress executor](https://nx.dev/packages/cypress/executors/cypress) for all CLI flags.

Run `nx test my-app` to execute the unit tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io), or `nx affected:test` to execute just unit tests affected by a change. You can also use `--watch` with these test to run jest in watch mode, see [Jest executor](https://nx.dev/packages/jest/executors/jest) for all CLI flags.

#### Trading app E2E tests

To run tests locally using your own wallets you can add the following environment variables to `cypress.json`

1. Change `TRADING_TEST_VEGA_WALLET_NAME` to your Vega wallet name
2. Add `TRADING_TEST_VEGA_WALLET_PASSPHRASE` as your wallet passphrase
3. Add `ETH_WALLET_MNEMONIC` as your Ethereum wallet mnemonic

### Formatting

In CI linting, formatting and also run. These checks can be seen in the [CI workflow file](.github/workflows//test.yml).

- To fix linting errors locally run `yarn nx lint --fix`
- To fix formatting errors local run `yarn nx format:write`
- For either command you may use `--all` to run across the entire repository

# Docker & Vegacapsule

## Docker

The [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) for running the frontends is pretty basic, merely building the application with the APP arg that is passed in and serving the application from [nginx](./nginx/nginx.conf). The only complexity that exists is that there is a script which allows the passing of run time environment variables to the containers. See configuration below for how to do this.

You can build any of the containers locally with the following command:

```bash
docker build . --build-arg APP=[YOUR APP] --tag=[TAG]
```

In order to run a container:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:80 [TAG]
```

## Config

As environment variables are build time and not run time in frontend applications. We have built a system which allows for passing run time environment variables, this generates a JSON file that will override the default environment variables that the container was built with (which is always testnet, using the default .env files).

In order to override specific environment variables you can pass these to the container like this:

```bash
docker run -e NX_VEGA_URL=https://api.n04.d.vega.xyz/graphql -p 3000:80 [TAG]
```

Which will now point the app to use a devnet data node. To see a list of all possible config properties see the readme.md for each app in the app directory.

## Vega capsule

Coming soon! You will be able to run the containers within Vega Capsule.

You can run against a local instance of Vega Capsule today by using the .env.capsule present in the apps.
