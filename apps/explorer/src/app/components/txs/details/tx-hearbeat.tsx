/**
 * Validator Heartbeat transactions are a way for non-consensus validators to signal that they
 * are still alive, still following along, and still valid for consideration in the validator set.
 * To indicate they are still alive, they use their Ethereum and Vega private keys to provide two
 * signatures of a recent block on chain.
 *
 * Blocks must be signed within 500 seconds (i.e. roughly 500 blocks) to not be considered stale
 *
 * For the sake of block explorer, these design decisions were made:
 * - The signature values are not interesting. They're available in details but not worth displaying
 * - Freshness is a word that isn't used anywhere else. It's meant to imply how close to the lower
 *   bound the signature was. But it doesn't matter as long as it's less than 500.
