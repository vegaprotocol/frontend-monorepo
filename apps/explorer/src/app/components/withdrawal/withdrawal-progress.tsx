/**
 * Shows a user the *current* state of a proposal. Which sound easy, but.. strap in
 * 1. Step one is the submission and acceptance of the WithdrawalSubmission. If it is not rejected, it is accepted and we can mark it as complete
 * 2. Is complete when there is a multisig bundle available to the user. This means that their funds have been moved to an account locked for
 *    withdrawal. To move out of this phase, the user (any user - but realistically the owner of the recipient address) needs to execute the withdrawal
 *    bundle on Ethereum, then we progress to.
 * 3. The funds have left the ERC20 bridge and been sent to the user. This is complete.
 *
 * There could actually be some extra complexity:
 * - If a deposit is above { asset { withdrawalThreshold } } then the multisig bundle is still produced (step 2) but cannot be submitted for a period
 *   of time. The period of time is defined on the ERC20 bridge. Attempts to submit the multisig bundle before that would be rejected.
 * - The bridge could be paused, which would cause attempts to complete step three to be rejected
 *
 * Also:
 * - 1 -> 2 is completed automatically by the system
 * - 2 -> 3 requires action from the user
 * - Any user with an Ethereum wallet can complete 2 -> 3 as above, but it will likely be the person who owns the vega public key of the source and
 *   the ethereum public key of the recipient. Whoever is looking at this page may be none of those people.
