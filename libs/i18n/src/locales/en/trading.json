  "DISCLAIMER_P1": "Vega is a decentralised peer-to-peer protocol that can be used to trade derivatives with cryptoassets. The Vega Protocol is an implementation layer (layer one) protocol made of free, public, open-source or source-available software. Use of the Vega Protocol involves various risks, including but not limited to, losses while digital assets are supplied to the Vega Protocol and losses due to the fluctuation of prices of assets.",
  "DISCLAIMER_P2": "Before using the Vega Protocol, review the relevant documentation at docs.vega.xyz to make sure that you understand how it works. Conduct your own due diligence and consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions.",
  "DISCLAIMER_P3": "As described in the Vega Protocol core license, the Vega Protocol is provided “as is”, at your own risk, and without warranties of any kind. Although Gobalsky Labs Limited developed much of the initial code for the Vega Protocol, it does not provide or control the Vega Protocol, which is run by third parties deploying it on a bespoke blockchain. Upgrades and modifications to the Vega Protocol are managed in a community-driven way by holders of the VEGA governance token.",
  "DISCLAIMER_P4": "No developer or entity involved in creating the Vega Protocol will be liable for any claims or damages whatsoever associated with your use, inability to use, or your interaction with other users of the Vega Protocol, including any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages, or legal costs, or loss of profits, cryptoassets, tokens or anything else of value.",
