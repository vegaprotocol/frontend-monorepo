# Staking income

## Monitor staking rewards

When checking the staking rewards, I...

- must be [connected to a Vega wallet](0002-WCON-connect_vega_wallet.md)

- **must** see when the current epoch ends <a name="2002-SINC-001" href="#2002-SINC-001">2002-SINC-001</a>
- **should** see when the current epoch started
- **should** see how much the connected wallet might earn at the end of the epoch (with some assumptions)
  - **should** see the balance of all infrastructure fee accounts for the current epoch
  - **should** see real time validator score for the current epoch
  - **should** see if any validators have had a penalty this epoch
- **must** see the sum of Tokens I have nominated to each validator in the current epoch <a name="2002-SINC-007" href="#2002-SINC-007">2002-SINC-007</a>
- **should** see what percentage of my Tokens I have nominated to each validator in the current epoch
- **must** see the staking income I have received for each epoch previous <a name="2002-SINC-009" href="#2002-SINC-009">2002-SINC-009</a>
  - **must** see asset name <a name="2002-SINC-010" href="#2002-SINC-010">2002-SINC-010</a>
  - **must** see balance of asset <a name="2002-SINC-011" href="#2002-SINC-011">2002-SINC-011</a>
  - **must** see type (organic or treasury) <a name="2002-SINC-012" href="#2002-SINC-012">2002-SINC-012</a>
- **should** see the staking income by epoch, broken down by validator
- **should** see the staking income by epoch, broken down by market

- **should** see all income values expressed in a single currency

- **must** see current asset balances for connected wallets <a name="2002-SINC-016" href="#2002-SINC-016">2002-SINC-016</a>
- **must** see link to [withdraw](1002-WITH-withdraw.md) assets <a name="2002-SINC-017" href="#2002-SINC-017">2002-SINC-017</a>

- **must** see where I can see where I did not receive full income because the validator suffered penalties <a name="2002-SINC-018" href="#2002-SINC-018">2002-SINC-018</a>

...so that I can make decisions about my staking
