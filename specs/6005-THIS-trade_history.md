# Trade history

As a market user I want to be aware about trades that are being made in the market.

- I **Must** see Trades tab (<a name="6005-THIS-001" href="#6005-THIS-001">6005-THIS-001</a>)
- I **Must** see Trades table filled with trades that were done in the market (<a name="6005-THIS-002" href="#6005-THIS-002">6005-THIS-002</a>)
- I **Must** see Price of each trade (<a name="6005-THIS-003" href="#6005-THIS-003">6005-THIS-003</a>)
- I **Must** see Size of each trade (<a name="6005-THIS-004" href="#6005-THIS-004">6005-THIS-004</a>)
- I **Must** see date and time of each trade (<a name="6005-THIS-005" href="#6005-THIS-005">6005-THIS-005</a>)
- I **Must** see most recent trades on the top of the table (<a name="6005-THIS-006" href="#6005-THIS-006">6005-THIS-006</a>)
- When I click specific price, it **Must** be copied to deal ticket form (<a name="6005-THIS-007" href="#6005-THIS-007">6005-THIS-007</a>)
