# Submit order

As a user I want change my exposure on a market (e.g. open a position, increase or decrease my open volume), I want to submit an order with instructions for how my order should be executed so I have some control over the price that I get, as well as if when/my order should stay on the book. See [specs about orders](../protocol#orders) for more info.

## Before seeing a "deal ticket"

When looking at a market, I...

- **must** see/select the [Market](./9001-DATA-data_display.md#market) I am submitting the order for (<a name="7002-SORD-001" href="#7002-SORD-001">7002-SORD-001</a>)
- **must** see the current `status` of the market (<a name="7002-SORD-061" href="#7002-SORD-061">7002-SORD-061</a>)

  if the market is in a state of `rejected`, `canceled` or `closed`:

  - **must** see that the market is not accepting orders and never will be (<a name="7002-SORD-062" href="#7002-SORD-062">7002-SORD-062</a>)

  if the market is in a state of `tradingTerminated`:

  - **must** see that the market is not accepting orders and never will be (<a name="7002-SORD-063" href="#7002-SORD-063">7002-SORD-063</a>)
  - **should** see the [price](9001-DATA-data_display.md#quote-price) that was used to settle the market
  - **should** see a link to oracle spec and data

  if the market is in a state of `settled`:

  - **must** see that the market is not accepting orders and never will be (<a name="7002-SORD-066" href="#7002-SORD-066">7002-SORD-066</a>)
  - **should** see the oracle events that terminated the market
  - **should** see a link to oracle spec and data

  if the market is in a state of `suspended`:

  - **should** see what suspended the market
  - **should** see the conditioned required for the auction to end
  - **should** see the current data values that the auction end is measured against (e.g. Supplied stake)

...so I know if the market is accepting orders.

The rest of this document only applies if the state of the market is `pending`, `active` or `suspended`:

## Deal ticket

When populating a deal ticket I...

## Manage positions and order

After submitting orders I'll want to [manage orders](7003-MORD-manage_orders.md). If my orders resulted in a position I may wish to [manage positions](7004-POSI-positions.md)).

# Typical order scenarios to design/test for

Market in continuous trading:

- Limit order, Long, GTC, with a price that is lower than the current price
- Limit order, Short, GFN, that crosses the book but only gets a partial fill when order is processed
- Market order, IOC, that increases open volume (aka size of position)
- a limit order GFA when market is in Auction
- an limit that reduces exposure from something to 0
- a limit order, FOK, that squares and reverses e.g. I'm long 10, I short 20 to end short 10

Market in auction:

- Attempt Market order in Auction mode: should warn order is invalid
- Attempt limit order GFN when market is normally Continuous (but currently in auction), should warn that GFN will not work
