# Data display

This is a definition of some common data types and the rules about the displaying them. These are referenced in other acceptance criteria to avoid repetition.

## Size

> aka contracts, volume, amount, quantities.

This is set per-market and represent the number of contracts that are being brought or sold.

`Market.positionDecimalPlaces` tells us where to put the decimal when displaying the number. Size can be a whole number if `Market.positionDecimalPlaces` = 0, or a [fractional order](../protocol/0052-FPOS-fractional_orders_positions.md) if > 0.
It **should** always be displayed to the full number of decimal places. however, there may be exceptions, e.g. when visualizing on a depth chart, where the precision is not required.

## Quote price

> aka. price, quote, level.

This is set per-market and represent the "price" of an asset. It can have a 1-1 relationship with the settlement asset but it is also possible that products will have different payoff methods, which is one of the reasons we don't just use settlement asset, another being in the future some markets could have multiple settlement assets, another being that we don't want 18DP quotes.

`Market.decimalPlaces` tells us where to put the decimal when displaying the number. It can be a whole number if `Market.decimalPlaces` = 0, but will not have more decimal places than the [settlement asset](#asset-balances) of a market.

`Market...quoteName` is used to tell us what to display next to the quote price. For example the `quoteName` could be `USD` but the settlement asset = `DAI`. The Market framework allows for other types of quote (e.g. %, cm and ETC). When looking at a single market it may not be necessary to show the quote name each time you show the price.

### Mark price

The term mark price is often displayed as the best possible price from which to base calculations on what the current price is of the market. It is used for margin calculations and unrealised Profit/loss estimates.

### Liquidation price

This is a value that is calculated as an indication of what price the market would be at for a position to be liquidated. To do this ti has to make a few assumptions and simulate the Vega topping up the margin balance each time the position hits the search level. More detail in the [this notebook](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/research/blob/master/notebooks/misc/Margin%20level%20price%20approximation.ipynb).

## Asset balances

> aka Collateral, account balance, Profit and loss, PnL fees, transfers, financial values.

The is set per Asset and represents the amount of an asset that is held in the bridge.

Once deposited assets appear in a `general account`. Other account types are created when opening positions, providing liquidity etc.
Vega does not return a `total balance` that is a sum of all accounts in a currency, but users will expect to see one. See the [Collateral spec](../protocol/0005-COLL-collateral.md) for other account types.

`Asset.decimals` tells the UIs where to put the decimal place. Ethereum assets often have 18 decimal places, but can have less. Forms where you deposit, withdraw or transfer assets must show all decimal places. It may be appropriate to truncate at a certain number of DP in many cases (e.g. `0.01` instead of `0.012345678912345678` event though `0.001 wBTC` may be worth as much as than `0.01 ETH`). At the moment Vega does not have a source of information that allows conversion of currencies or way of knowing that the significant value of an asset is.

## Profit and Loss

> aka PnL, P&L

The profit or loss is the difference between what a user paid for a thing and the value of it at any given moment. For future it is the difference between the price

### Unrealised Profit and Loss

### Realised Profit and Loss

## Quantum

The quantum is a value that is used to define "The minimum economically meaningful amount of this specific asset". It can be used to show only the number of decimal places that are meaningful in summary information. A quantum is defined on each asset.

## Market

Markets do not have names, technically it is the instrument within a market that has the name. Theoretically the same instrument can be traded in multiple markets. if/when this happens a user needs to be able to disambiguate between markets. Each market does have a unique ID, Note: this is a hash of the definition of the market when it was created.
Instruments have both a Name and Code, see [market framework](../protocol/0001-MKTF-market_framework.md) for how these are used. Generally the Code can save space once a user is familiar with the market. The Name is more descriptive and should be the default when discovering markets. It remains to be seen how the community will use these exactly.
Markets can have several statuses and it may be sensible when listing markets to highlight their status. e.g. if a market is usually in continuous trading mode, but is currently in an auction due to low liquidity. The market name field could be augmented to show the status (add an icon etc).

## Public keys

> aka Party

When looking at a public key it is important that the user can get the full public key but it is often appropriate just to show an abbreviated form. The first 6 and last 6 characters are preferable, with an indication that it is truncated e.g. `56d1e6739deac3c5c1ddc6fee876b3217e504a161b5b00fda96b40ed3e8f89b8` as `56d1e6...8f89b8` or just `8f89b8` if enough of a convention has been established. In cases where the key being shows comes from your connected wallet it should also show the name (aka alias) of the key.
Vega public keys are hexadecimal, but the convention is to display them without the preceding `0x` as this is what the Vega API returns.

## Party accounts

> aka account balances

A can have a number of different accounts for any given asset.

- General account - For assets that have not been deployed to one of the following
- Margin accounts - one for each market the part has orders/position
- Bond accounts - (aka liquidity commitment) one for each market the user has committed to providing liquidity on
- Locked for withdraw - one for each withdraw that is waiting to be finalised (e.g. where withdrawal limits/time locks are in place)

In the case of the Governance token the party may also have staked balances

When listing markets in a breakdown it may good to see a total exposure to a market, that is then broken down by Margin and Bond

All party accounts should be displayed as an [asset balance](#asset-balances) with the appropriate number of decimal places.

## Transaction hash

> aka Transaction ID, txn, tx

The transaction [hash](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hash.asp) acts as an identifier for a transaction network. It is hexadecimal and should be displayed with the preceding `0x`.

## Asset

> aka Collateral

### Asset name

e.g. United states Dollar. Each asset has a name this should be shown (as well as symbol) in places where the user may need to distinguish one asset from another or if the symbol is ambiguous. Vega assets names aught to match their name on their native chain.

### Asset symbol

e.g USD. Symbols are short codes for an asset to be used in places low on space where the user is likely to be familiar with the asset. Often all caps but not always, so it is important to display upper and lower case. Vega assets codes aught to match their name on their native chain.
